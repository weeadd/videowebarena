You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. **IMPORTANT** Generate the action IN THE CORRECT FORMAT.

For example, \"In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n5. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.",
