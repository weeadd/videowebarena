    "intro": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nA list of frames sampled from a video tutorial about this task or a similar task and the audio transcription.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous action: This is the action you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n```click [id]```: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n```type [id] [content]```: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0, i.e., ```type [id] [content] [0]```.\n```hover [id]```: Hover over an element with id.\n```press [key_comb]```:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n```scroll [down]``` or ```scroll [up]```: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n```new_tab```: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n```tab_focus [tab_index]```: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n```close_tab```: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n```goto [url]```: Navigate to a specific URL.\n```go_back```: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n```go_forward```: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n```stop [answer]```: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\nhttp://homepage.com/password.html lists all the account name and password for the websites. You can use them to log in to the websites.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. Generate the action in the correct format. Start with a \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n5. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.",

        "VIDEO:\n [FRAME-1] [FRAME-2] [FRAME-3] [FRAME-4] [FRAME-5] \nAUDIO:\n  Hi everyone, welcome to a tutorial on the One Stop Market. Today this is just a general tutorial video and how to get around on things. So one thing you need to get to an item is simply click on the title or the image. And as you can see here is going to take me to the title. From here I can edit the quantity, add the cart, add to my wish list, add to my comparisons, and I can access through views here. Similarly if I go to this I will be very similar, this one has 12 views so I can see 12 views, I can also leave my own review at the bottom here. And then if I want to add items to my cart and just click add to cart, if I want to add to my wish list I can click the red heart button. Similarly I add a cart, sometimes you are going to get prompted with an option to add items details before I add the cart. Other times it is not going to be an option like here, add to your comparison page here as well. And so if I want to go to different sections I can go here, let's go to Xbox One, let's go and have a look. There are also subsections within categories, so these are also categories, so accessories is also a category. Let's find the most expensive item. And you can do this by sorting my price and then flipping the arrow, it says to my cart, let's get it in black, and then similarly you can go to my cart here. I'm going to go to view it on a cart and we can see that our cart is here and if I want to go back to the One Stop Market this is how things go. So I hope this helps and thanks for watching. \nOBSERVATION: [28] [A] [Pre-baked Gingerbread House Kit Value Pack, 17 oz., Pack of 2, Total 34 oz.] [] [StaticText] [$19.99] [30] [BUTTON] [Add to Cart] [34] [A] [V8 +Energy, Healthy Energy Drink, Steady Energy from Black and Green Tea, Pomegranate Blueberry, 8 Ounce Can, Pack of 24] [] [StaticText] [$14.47] [36] [BUTTON] [Add to Cart] [40] [A] [Elmwood Inn Fine Teas, Orange Vanilla Caffeine-free Fruit Infusion, 16-Ounce Pouch] [] [StaticText] [$19.36] [42] [BUTTON] [Add to Cart] [43] [A] [Add to Wish List]\nURL: http://onestopmarket.com\nOBJECTIVE: Can you take me to the product page for the first item added to the cart in the video?\nPREVIOUS ACTION: None",
